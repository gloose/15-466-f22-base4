[Go back to sleep]

To hell with this. You're no time traveler. You aren't the kind of person to create entire timelines full of doomed people in a vain attempt to rewrite history. You're here in your home. You just want to sleep. In an hour or so, your mother will come wake you up with a song like she always did. You gave yourself some time; you still have a few months until the Calamity. You're going to spend it with your family. It's all you ever wanted.

You have achieved Ending Z: ZZZZZZZZZZZ
