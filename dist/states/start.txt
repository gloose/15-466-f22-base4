It has been 60 years since the Calamity, the viral outbreak that killed 90% of the global population almost overnight. In that time, another 99% of what remained was lost to the relentless onslaught of the reanimated corpses of their fallen friends and family. Now, the final 0.1% of humanity hides in underground shelters, while the outside world belongs only to the undead.

For most, this is the only life they have ever known. Few have lived as long as you have, long enough to remember a happy life with your family before they all died in the initial outbreak and left you alone. If it were possible, you would do anything to bring them back. Today, you are finally given a chance.

A gentle hand tugs on your sleeve. You look down and take in a bizarre sight: a small child, hardly more than a toddler, with both arms sleeved in dozens of comically oversized digital watches. Having gained your attention, she begins to speak with a fluency of language far exceeding her apparent age.

*Child: Excuse me, sir? If I might ask, [how old are you]?

( What should I say? I can scroll up and down with the mouse wheel, and select a dialogue option from below with the left mouse button. I can also select a topic from any yellow text from the story so far. It won't always get me a response, but in this case I think I should try asking this person as many questions as I can. )

[I'm 72 years old]
