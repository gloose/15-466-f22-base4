You enter the day of the Calamity into the watch interface, half expecting that nothing will happen and this will all prove to be an elaborate joke. At first, you think you were right; you see none of the special effects one might find in a sci-fi film, and you are still on the same road you remember. The illusion is shattered when a black pickup truck swerves past you, accompanied by a blaring horn and a raised finger extending from the driver side window. Sprinting off to the side of the road out of the oncoming traffic, you find yourself filled with a youthful energy, and look down at yourself to see the body of a child in comically oversized clothing. Everything is exactly as your strange visitor described.

You hear a ping as your watch lights up with a text notification. You tap the screen and see a message from an unknown sender.

*???: "Time travel signature received. I have to admit, I never thought I would be the one receiving a visit from my future self; I've always been the one doing the visiting. How exciting! Well, what is it this time? Gonna [tell me not to do it]? Do we use the Extractor only to finally find a shred of remorse in our heart over the extinction of humanity?"

*You: ...

[Kairos sent me to kill you.]
