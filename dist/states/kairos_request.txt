*Kairos: "That was rhetorical."

*Kairos: "Look, I'd really prefer if this wasn't the case, but I need your help. There's a rogue time traveler out there. Goes by Chronos. No, obviously that's not his real name, he just fancies himself some kind of time god. I don't know how, but he managed to convert every living person in this timeline into fuel for his time machine. Everyone except you, it seems. Quite fatal for the rest of them, I'm afraid. Now, instead of being limited to his own age, he draws on the combined age of 8 billion people. He can literally go to any time in the entire history or future of Earth. Want to guess whether he's been using that power for good?"

*Kairos: "Long story short, I need you to go back and stop him. It's too far back for me, I've only got 5 years of age left. Any further than that and I get... unborn. Never tried it, but sounds unpleasant. But you... you would be 12 years old back then. That's old enough to take down a would-be time god, eh?"

*Kairos: "Anyway, enough talk. Off you go then. Come back to the present when it's done."

Kairos reaches into his pockets and pulls out an elaborate digital watch, matching the one he wears, and an oversized pistol whose barrel pulses out an unnerving red glow. He straps the former to your wrist and puts the latter in your hand. Before you can say a word, a calendar-like interface appears on your watch and a soothing feminine voice greets you.

*Time Machine: "When would you like to travel?"
