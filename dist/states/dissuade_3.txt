[yourself]

*You: Yourself. I am you from the future, Z.

*Z: ...

*Z: ...

*Z: ...I knew it was possible. But I can't trust you. Prove to me that you have seen the future. What exactly am I going to do?

You describe to him the events of the Calamity in vivid detail. He seems satisfied, both with your answer and with his future accomplishments.

*Z: Very well. I believe that you are a time traveler. But any time traveler would know what you have described. How do I know that you are myself?

With the fate of humanity on the line, you desperately search your memories for anything that could convince this madman to believe your story.
