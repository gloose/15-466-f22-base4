# Crisis Averted

Author: Greg Loose

Design: Crisis Averted is a text-based adventure game about going back in time to prevent the apocalypse. Use your knowledge of the future to change the past and earn one of four different endings (one of which isn't a joke).

Text Drawing: (TODO: how does the text drawing in this game work? Is text precomputed? Rendered at runtime? What files or utilities are involved?)

Choices: (TODO: how does the game store choices and narrative? How are they authored? Anything nifty you want to point out?)

Screen Shot:

How To Play:

(TODO: describe the controls and (if needed) goals/strategy.)

Sources: (TODO: list a source URL for any assets you did not create yourself. Make sure you have a license for the asset.)

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
